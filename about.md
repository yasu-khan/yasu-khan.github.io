Hey there! I am Yasser Khan and I dabble in RDBMS, No-SQL, Microservices, Cloud Platforms(AWS and Oracle Cloud), Programming langauges(Python, Shell, Perl, SQL, Java Script), Version Control(Git), Docker, DevOps, Engineered Systems, Distributed systems and Open source.


You can find me at these places but the most reliable way to reach me is to send an email. Please note that due to the large influx of email, it might take 2-3 business days for me to reply back.
